# test-essays

Test exists to reduce entropy.

Tests in the application domain are generally the ones that create the most value.

Test coverage are a good negative (not positive) indicator.

Generally in-domain tests tend to be more classic and out-of-domain tests tend to be more mockists.

Tests that fail for no reason decrease your ability to react to problems. They often cause confidence in test suites to decrease, making you think that every time a test breaks it's because it was refactored. You stop view your test suite as a reliable feedback source.

Test is for testing behavior, refactoring doesn't change behavior, so tests shouldn't break because of refactoring.

Refactoring is extremely underrated and very important, without good testing we will not have continuous refactoring.

You might think that testing mediocre is at least doing something, but bad test suites in extreme cases can be worse than not testing at all. We must strive for excellence in testing and not accept poor quality.
